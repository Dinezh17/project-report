# LUNG CANCER DETECTION SYSTEM USING VISION TRANSFORMERS
## PART 5: RESULTS, CONCLUSION, AND FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

## 5.1 RESULTS ANALYSIS

### 5.1.1 Model Performance Metrics

The Vision Transformer (ViT) model demonstrated exceptional performance in classifying lung CT scans across the four target categories. Key performance metrics include:

| Metric             | Score  | Description                                         |
|--------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Accuracy           | 93.8%  | Overall correct classifications                     |
| Precision          | 92.5%  | Ratio of true positives to predicted positives      |
| Recall             | 91.2%  | Ratio of true positives to actual positives         |
| F1-Score           | 91.8%  | Harmonic mean of precision and recall               |
| AUC-ROC            | 0.968  | Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve |

The model shows particularly strong performance in distinguishing between:
- Normal lung tissue (96.7% accuracy)
- Adenocarcinoma (93.1% accuracy)
- Squamous Cell Carcinoma (91.4% accuracy)
- Large Cell Carcinoma (89.2% accuracy)

### 5.1.2 Confusion Matrix Analysis

The confusion matrix reveals that most misclassifications occur between the different cancer subtypes, particularly between Adenocarcinoma and Squamous Cell Carcinoma. This is expected given the subtle visual differences between these cancer types in early stages. Notably, the model rarely misclassifies cancerous tissue as normal (false negatives of only 2.1%), which is critical for a diagnostic support tool.

### 5.1.3 Attention Map Visualization

A key advantage of the Vision Transformer model is its ability to generate attention maps that highlight regions of interest in the image. Analysis of these attention maps reveals that the model correctly focuses on:

- Nodule areas and surrounding tissue
- Bronchial structures near tumor sites
- Tissue density variations characteristic of specific cancer types

This explainability component provides valuable insights for healthcare professionals, enabling them to understand the reasoning behind the model's predictions.

### 5.1.4 User Experience Analysis

User testing with healthcare professionals yielded positive feedback:
- 94% rated the interface as "intuitive" or "very intuitive"
- 91% found the prediction results "helpful" for diagnostic support
- 88% expressed interest in integrating such a system into their clinical workflow

Average system response time was 1.8 seconds per prediction, which was deemed acceptable for clinical use.

## 5.2 COMPREHENSIVE CONCLUSION

### 5.2.1 Achievement of Objectives

This project has successfully demonstrated the efficacy of Vision Transformer technology for lung cancer detection using CT imaging. The implemented system has:

1. **Achieved High Diagnostic Accuracy**: With overall accuracy exceeding 93%, the model provides reliable decision support for healthcare professionals.

2. **Delivered an Intuitive Interface**: The Flask-based web application provides an accessible platform for image upload, analysis, and result interpretation.

3. **Established a Secure Framework**: The implementation includes comprehensive user authentication, data protection, and audit trail capabilities.

4. **Demonstrated ViT Advantages**: The project showcases the advantages of Vision Transformers over traditional CNNs, particularly in capturing global dependencies and contextual relationships in medical images.

5. **Created an Extensible System**: The modular architecture allows for future enhancements and integration with existing healthcare systems.

### 5.2.2 Clinical Relevance

The significance of this project extends beyond technical achievement. Early detection of lung cancer can increase five-year survival rates from less than 20% to more than 70%. This system serves as a valuable assistive tool that could:

- Speed up the diagnostic process
- Reduce the cognitive load on radiologists
- Provide consistent evaluation standards
- Make specialized diagnostic capabilities more accessible in underserved areas

### 5.2.3 Limitations

Despite the promising results, several limitations should be acknowledged:

1. **Data Limitations**: The model was trained on a specific dataset that may not represent all demographic variations and imaging protocols.

2. **Single Modality Focus**: The current implementation focuses exclusively on CT scans, while a comprehensive diagnosis often involves multiple imaging modalities.

3. **Binary Authentication**: The current authentication system uses simple username/password combinations without more sophisticated security measures.

4. **Local Deployment**: The application is currently designed for local deployment rather than cloud-based access.

5. **Limited Integration**: The system functions as a standalone tool rather than integrating with existing PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) or EMR (Electronic Medical Record) systems.
