# DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A DEEP LEARNING MODEL FOR EARLY LUNG CANCER DETECTION USING CT IMAGING

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

Lung cancer remains one of the most lethal forms of cancer worldwide, with particularly high prevalence in India alongside prostate, mouth, and breast cancer. The high mortality rate associated with lung cancer is largely attributed to late-stage diagnosis, when treatment options become limited and less effective. Early detection is crucial for improving survival rates, as it enables intervention when the disease is more manageable and treatment outcomes are significantly better.

Several factors contribute to the increasing incidence of lung cancer:

- **Tobacco use**: Smoking remains the primary risk factor, accounting for approximately 85% of all lung cancer cases.
- **Rising pollution levels**: Particularly in urban areas, air pollution containing carcinogenic particles has been linked to increased lung cancer risk.
- **Occupational exposure**: Workers in industries dealing with asbestos, radon, arsenic, and other carcinogenic substances face elevated risks.
- **Genetic factors**: Family history and genetic predisposition can increase susceptibility.

While men are traditionally affected at higher rates due to higher smoking prevalence, the gap is narrowing as smoking rates among women have increased in many regions. The universal risk posed by lung cancer to both genders underscores the importance of developing effective, accessible, and accurate diagnostic tools.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Traditional lung cancer detection methods face several challenges:

1. **Radiologist dependency**: Conventional diagnosis relies heavily on the expertise of radiologists, introducing potential for human error and interpretation variability.
2. **Resource limitations**: Many healthcare facilities, particularly in developing regions, face shortages of qualified radiologists.
3. **Detection sensitivity**: Early-stage nodules may be small and difficult to distinguish, leading to missed diagnoses.
4. **Processing time**: Manual analysis of CT scans and X-rays is time-consuming, limiting the number of patients who can be screened.

These challenges highlight the need for automated, reliable, and efficient diagnostic tools that can assist healthcare professionals in early lung cancer detection, particularly in resource-constrained settings.

### 1.3 Project Objectives

This project aims to address these challenges through the following objectives:

1. Design and implement a Vision Transformer (ViT) based deep learning model capable of analyzing CT scan images to detect and classify lung cancer with high accuracy.
2. Develop a user-friendly web application that allows healthcare professionals to upload medical images and receive rapid, reliable diagnostic predictions.
3. Create a secure system for storing patient data and prediction history for longitudinal analysis and reference.
4. Evaluate the system's performance against established benchmarks to ensure clinical reliability.
5. Establish a foundation for future enhancements and expansions of the system's capabilities.

## 2. PROJECT OVERVIEW

## 3. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### 3.1 High-Level System Architecture

The system follows a three-tier architecture that separates concerns and promotes modularity:

1. **Presentation Layer (Frontend)**
   - Implements the user interface using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap
   - Provides forms for user registration, login, and image upload
   - Displays prediction results and user dashboard
   - Ensures responsive design for various devices

2. **Application Layer (Backend)**
   - Powered by Flask framework with Python
   - Handles HTTP requests and responses
   - Implements business logic for authentication, image processing, and prediction
   - Manages sessions and user state
   - Interfaces with the deep learning model for inference

3. **Data Layer**
   - Uses SQLite database for storing user credentials and prediction records
   - Maintains relationships between users and their prediction history
   - Stores file paths to uploaded images for reference

### 3.2 Web Application Architecture

#### 3.2.1 Component Diagram

The web application architecture consists of the following components:

- **Authentication Component**: Handles user registration, login, and session management
- **File Upload Component**: Manages the secure upload and storage of medical images
- **Prediction Component**: Interfaces with the ViT model to process images and generate predictions
- **Dashboard Component**: Retrieves and displays user's prediction history
- **Database Interface Component**: Manages all interactions with the SQLite database

#### 3.2.2 Data Flow

1. User registers an account or logs in to an existing account
2. Authentication component validates credentials and establishes a session
3. User uploads a CT scan image through the file upload component
4. Image is preprocessed and sent to the prediction component
5. Prediction component passes the processed image to the ViT model
6. Model generates a classification with probability scores
7. Result is displayed to the user and stored in the database
8. User can view their prediction history through the dashboard component

### 3.3 ViT Model Architecture

The Vision Transformer (ViT) model architecture consists of several key components:

#### 3.3.1 Input Processing

- **Image Patching**: The input CT scan is divided into fixed-size patches (16x16 pixels)
- **Patch Embedding**: Each patch is linearly transformed into an embedding vector
- **Position Embedding**: Position information is added to maintain spatial awareness
- **Class Token**: A special [CLS] token is prepended to the sequence for classification

#### 3.3.2 Transformer Encoder

- **Multi-Head Self-Attention Layers**: Allow the model to focus on different image regions simultaneously
- **Layer Normalization**: Normalizes inputs to each sub-layer for stable training
- **Feed-Forward Networks**: Process the attention outputs through non-linear transformations
- **Residual Connections**: Facilitate gradient flow during training

#### 3.3.3 Classification Head

- **MLP Classifier**: A simple multi-layer perceptron that processes the [CLS] token representation
- **Output Layer**: Produces logits for the four target classes:
  - Adenocarcinoma
  - Large Cell Carcinoma
  - Normal
  - Squamous Cell Carcinoma

### 3.4 Database Design

The application uses SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM for data persistence, with a schema consisting of two primary tables:

#### 3.4.1 User Table

```
User:
- id: Integer, Primary Key, Auto-increment
- username: String(80), Unique, Not Null
- password: String(120), Not Null
```

The User table stores authentication information for system users, primarily healthcare professionals. Each user has a unique username and a password (which would be hashed in a production environment for security).

#### 3.4.2 Prediction Table

```
Prediction:
- id: Integer, Primary Key, Auto-increment
- user_id: Integer, Foreign Key referencing User.id
- image_path: String(200), Not Null
- prediction: String(50), Not Null
```

The Prediction table stores the results of each analysis performed by the system. It maintains a foreign key relationship with the User table, allowing each prediction to be associated with the user who requested it. The `image_path` field stores the location of the uploaded image, while the `prediction` field contains the classification result along with its confidence score.

This relational structure facilitates:
- Secure user authentication
- Association between users and their predictions
- Efficient retrieval of prediction history for each user
- Data organization for potential future analytics

### 3.5 System Workflow

The system workflow illustrates the sequence of operations from user registration to prediction retrieval:

1. **User Registration**:
   - New user submits registration form with username and password
   - System validates input and checks for username uniqueness
   - User record is created in the database
   - User is automatically logged in and directed to the main interface

2. **User Authentication**:
   - Returning user submits login credentials
   - System validates credentials against database records
   - Upon successful authentication, a session is created
   - User is directed to the main interface

3. **Image Upload and Prediction**:
   - User selects and uploads a CT scan image
   - System saves the image to a designated directory
   - Image is preprocessed according to ViT model requirements
   - Preprocessed image is passed to the model for inference
   - Model generates classification with probability scores
   - Result is displayed to the user and stored in the database

4. **Dashboard Access**:
   - User navigates to the dashboard
   - System retrieves all predictions associated with the user
   - Prediction history is displayed with images and results
   - User can review past diagnoses and track changes over time

5. **Logout**:
   - User initiates logout
   - System terminates the session
   - User is redirected to the home page

This comprehensive system architecture ensures a seamless experience for healthcare professionals while maintaining data security and enabling efficient lung cancer detection using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.
