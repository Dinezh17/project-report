## 3. SYSTEM SECURITY

### 3.1 Security Architecture

The security architecture follows a defense-in-depth strategy, implementing multiple layers of protection to safeguard patient data, maintain system integrity, and ensure compliance with healthcare data protection regulations.

### 3.2 Authentication and Authorization

#### 3.2.1 User Authentication Implementation

The current implementation uses username and password authentication with SQLite database storage:

```python
@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        username = request.form['username']
        password = request.form['password']
        user = User.query.filter_by(username=username, password=password).first()

        if user:
            session['user_id'] = user.id
            return redirect(url_for('index'))
        else:
            return render_template('login.html', error="Invalid credentials!")

    return render_template('login.html')
```

**Security Enhancement Recommendations**:
- Implement password hashing using bcrypt
- Add multi-factor authentication
- Enforce password complexity requirements
- Implement CAPTCHA for login attempts

#### 3.2.2 Session Management

The current implementation uses Flask's session management:

```python
app.secret_key = 'your_secret_key'  # For session management

@app.route('/logout', methods=['GET'])
def logout():
    session.pop('user_id', None)
    return redirect(url_for('home'))
```

**Security Enhancement Recommendations**:
- Use a strong, randomly generated secret key
- Implement session timeout
- Store session data server-side
- Set secure and HttpOnly cookie flags
- Implement CSRF protection

#### 3.2.3 Role-Based Access Control

For future implementation, a role-based access control system is recommended:

```python
class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    password = db.Column(db.String(120), nullable=False)
    role = db.Column(db.String(20), nullable=False, default='user')  # 'user', 'doctor', 'admin'

def requires_role(role):
    def decorator(f):
        @wraps(f)
        def decorated_function(*args, **kwargs):
            if 'user_id' not in session:
                return redirect(url_for('login'))
            
            user = User.query.get(session['user_id'])
            if user.role != role:
                return render_template('error.html', message="Insufficient permissions")
                
            return f(*args, **kwargs)
        return decorated_function
    return decorator

@app.route('/admin_dashboard')
@requires_role('admin')
def admin_dashboard():
    # Admin-only functionality
    return render_template('admin_dashboard.html')
```

### 3.3 Data Protection

#### 3.3.1 Data Encryption

- **Transport Layer Encryption**: Implementation of TLS/SSL for all client-server communications
- **Sensitive Data Encryption**: Encryption of sensitive medical data at rest

#### 3.3.2 Medical Image Data Protection

The current implementation stores images in the application's static directory:

```python
image_path = os.path.join(app.root_path, 'static/images', imagefile.filename)
imagefile.save(image_path)
```

**Security Enhancement Recommendations**:
- Implement unique filename generation to prevent path traversal attacks
- Validate file types and content before storage
- Implement access controls for stored images
- Consider encrypted storage for medical images

#### 3.3.3 Patient Data Anonymization

For medical applications, implementing data anonymization is crucial:

```python
def anonymize_medical_data(patient_data):
    # Remove or hash personally identifiable information
    anonymized_data = patient_data.copy()
    anonymized_data.pop('name', None)
    anonymized_data.pop('address', None)
    anonymized_data.pop('phone', None)
    anonymized_data.pop('email', None)
    
    # Generate anonymous identifier
    anonymized_data['patient_id'] = hashlib.sha256(
        patient_data['original_id'].encode() + app.secret_key.encode()
    ).hexdigest()
    
    return anonymized_data
```

### 3.4 Application Security

#### 3.4.1 Input Validation and Sanitization

All user inputs should be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks:

```python
def validate_username(username):
    # Alphanumeric usernames only
    if not username or not re.match(r'^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$', username):
        return False
    return True

@app.route('/register', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def register():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        username = request.form['username']
        password = request.form['password']
        
        if not validate_username(username):
            return render_template('register.html', error="Invalid username format")
        
        # Continue with registration process
```

#### 3.4.2 CSRF Protection

Implementation of Cross-Site Request Forgery protection:

```python
from flask_wtf.csrf import CSRFProtect

csrf = CSRFProtect(app)

# In HTML forms
<form method="post">
    <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="{{ csrf_token() }}"/>
    <!-- Form fields -->
</form>
```

#### 3.4.3 Security Headers

Configure proper security headers in the web server:

```
# Add to Nginx configuration
add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";
add_header X-Frame-Options "DENY";
add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'";
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains";
```
